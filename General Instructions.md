# General Instructions
Testing systems are potentially hazardous.

![Warning](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/b75b0104-2ed8-4e66-af28-24a18fc6236a)
Materials testing involves inherent hazards ranging from high forces, rapid motions, to stored energy. You must be aware of all moving and operating components that are potentially hazardous, particularly the actuator in a servo-hydraulic testing system or the moving crosshead in a testing system.

![Read Manuals](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/11e434fb-ed83-4002-8523-3d3d00f4eba1)
Carefully read all relevant manuals and observe any Warnings and Cautions. The term Warning is used where a hazard may lead to an injury or even death. The term Caution is used where a hazard may lead to potential equipment damage and severe loss of valuable data.

ITW India Private Limited (BISS Division) products comply with a wide range of national and international safety standards, applicable to materials and structural testing. Our products are intrinsically designed to the strict ITW India Private Limited (BISS Division) Safety Standard. (available on request)

Due to the wide range of practical applications for our appliances’ additional safety devices and necessary standard operating procedures are necessary to prevent unforeseen circumstances/accidents and upholding the safety norms. 

We strongly advise using additional safety devices such as protective shielding, warning signs, or methods of restricting equipment access, which is readily made available on request.

The following pages provide a detailed guide to various general warnings that you must always heed while using testing equipment. You will find more specific/niche Warnings and Cautions mentioned whenever a potential hazard exists.

To adhere to the safety guidelines, it is mandatory for you to gain a thorough understanding of the equipment by reading instruction manuals and to always use good judgment.

We strongly recommend that you carry out your product safety risk assessment.

**Warnings**
________________________________________________________________

**Hazard – Always ensure to press the Emergency Stop button whenever you consider that an environment is potentially unsafe**

![Warning](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/0d5a3de7-7bbc-4290-a99d-1e7e3310ee3c)
The Emergency Stop button shuts off hydraulic power or de-energizes electrical drive and avoids any unsafe actions. It does not isolate the system from electrical power, other means are provided to disconnect the electrical supply. Whenever you consider that safety is being compromised, stop the test using the Emergency Stop button. Investigate and resolve the situation yourself or contact an ITW India Private Limited (BISS Division) personnel before switching ON the machine.

**Flying Debris Hazard - Make sure that the test specimens are installed correctly in grips or fixtures in order to eliminate stresses that can lead to breakage of grip jaws or fixture components.**

Incorrect mounting of test specimens creates stresses in grip jaws or fixture components that can ultimately result in the breakage of these components. The high energies involved can cause the broken parts to be projected beyond the allocated test area. Ensure that you install specimens in the center of the grip jaws in line with the load path. Insert specimens into the jaws by at least the amount recommended in your grip documentation. This amount can vary between 66% to 100% insertion depths. (refer to supplied instructions for your specific grips) so we recommend you use the centering aid and alignment devices provided.
