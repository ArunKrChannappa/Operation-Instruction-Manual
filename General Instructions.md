To adhere to the safety guidelines, it is mandatory for you to gain a thorough understanding of the equipment by reading instruction manuals and to always use good judgment.

We strongly recommend that you carry out your product safety risk assessment.

**Warnings**
________________________________________________________________

**Hazard – Always ensure to press the Emergency Stop button whenever you consider that an environment is potentially unsafe**

![Warning](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/0d5a3de7-7bbc-4290-a99d-1e7e3310ee3c)
The Emergency Stop button shuts off hydraulic power or de-energizes electrical drive and avoids any unsafe actions. It does not isolate the system from electrical power, other means are provided to disconnect the electrical supply. Whenever you consider that safety is being compromised, stop the test using the Emergency Stop button. Investigate and resolve the situation yourself or contact an ITW India Private Limited (BISS Division) personnel before switching ON the machine.

**Flying Debris Hazard - Make sure that the test specimens are installed correctly in grips or fixtures in order to eliminate stresses that can lead to breakage of grip jaws or fixture components.**

![Helmet](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/740cbf69-f8a3-4529-8551-b096f51061bf)
Incorrect mounting of test specimens creates stresses in grip jaws or fixture components that can ultimately result in the breakage of these components. The high energies involved can cause the broken parts to be projected beyond the allocated test area. Ensure that you install specimens in the center of the grip jaws in line with the load path. Insert specimens into the jaws by at least the amount recommended in your grip documentation. This amount can vary between 66% to 100% insertion depths. (refer to supplied instructions for your specific grips) so we recommend you use the centering aid and alignment devices provided.

**Hazard - Protect electrical cables from damage and inadvertent disconnection**

![Warning](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/9b117ed0-b0b9-4930-8e2a-edb7f4950d88)
The loss of controlling and feedback signals due to a potentially disconnected or damaged cable causes an open-loop condition that may drive the actuator or crosshead rapidly to its extremes positions. Protect all electrical cables, particularly transducer cables, from damage. Never route cables across the floor without protection or suspend cables overhead under excessive strain. Use protective padding to avoid inter cable frictions especially around corners or through wall openings.

**Warnings**

**High/Low-Temperature Hazard - Wear protective clothing when handling equipment under extreme temperatures**

![High Temperature Hazard](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/bd4f42fe-91e5-46a1-a408-95fd3388418f)![Cryogenic Hazard](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/3258b8ed-2fe8-40c2-829a-4e6763a3c3af)

Materials testing is often carried out at non-ambient temperatures using ovens, furnaces, or cryogenic chambers. Extreme temperature implies an operating temperature exceeding 60 °C (140 °F) or below 0 °C (32 °F). You must use protective clothing, such as gloves when handling equipment at these temperatures. Display a warning notice concerning low or high-temperature operation whenever temperature control equipment is in use. You should note that the hazard from extreme temperatures can extend beyond the immediate test area.

**Crush Hazard - Take care when mounting or removing a specimen, assembly, structure, or load string component**

![Crush Hazard](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/ada82a89-4db6-4d79-990d-52a5290253bc)
Mounting or removal of a specimen, assembly, structure, or load string component involves working inside the impact zone between the grips or fixtures. When working in this area, ensure that no other personnel can remotely access or operate any of the system controls. Always keep clear of the jaws of a grip or fixture. Keep clear of the hazard area between the grips or fixtures during actuator or crosshead movement. Ensure that all actuator or crosshead movements necessary for mounting or removal are slow and, at a low force setting whenever possible.

**Hazard - Never place a testing system in the off-line mode in the computer control. Ensure that no actuator or crosshead movement will occur upon switching over to manual control**

![Warning](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/046bb93d-fa92-4e09-92db-1a31a84af1c3)
The actuator or crosshead will immediately respond to manual control settings when the system is placed off-line from computer control. Before transferring to manual control, make sure that the control settings are appropriately optimized to prevent any unexpected movements of the actuator or the crosshead.

**Warnings**
__________________________________________________

**Hazard - Set appropriate limits before performing loop tuning or running waveforms or tests**

![Warning](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/d14a0fda-5402-4ffb-a89f-1750902e4c3a)
Operational limits are included within the testing system to suspend motion or shut off the system when upper and/or lower bounds of actuator or crosshead travel, or force or strain, are reached during testing. Correct setting of operational limits by the operator, before testing, will drastically reduce the risk of damage to the test article, system, and consequently to the operator 

**Electrical Hazard - Disconnect the electrical power supply before removing the covers to electrical equipment**

![Electric Hazard](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/0ef073a1-16e2-4164-a8d2-994ffde40684)
Disconnect equipment from the electrical power supply before removing any electrical safety covers or replacing fuses. Do not reconnect the power source while the covers are removed. Refit covers immediately.

**Rotating Machinery Hazard - Disconnect power supplies before removing the covers to rotating machinery**

![Rotating Machine Hazard](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/b77f55c8-d6d2-4387-a570-fab22eb36c71)
Disconnect equipment from all power supplies before removing any cover which gives access to rotating machinery. Do not reconnect any power supply while the covers are removed unless you are specifically instructed to do so in the manual. If the equipment needs to be operated to perform maintenance tasks with the covers removed, ensure that all loose clothing, long hair, etc. is tied back neatly and refit covers immediately.

**Hazard - Shut down the hydraulic power supply and discharge hydraulic pressure before disconnection of any hydraulic fluid coupling**

![Warning](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/2139c39a-fb10-423f-9ca0-13e0bee9535c)
Do not disconnect any hydraulic coupling without first shutting down the hydraulic power supply and discharging stored pressure to zero. Tie-down or otherwise secure all pressurized hoses to prevent movement during system operation and to prevent the hose from whipping about in the event of a rupture.

**Hazard - Shut off the supply of compressed gas and discharge residual gas pressure before you disconnect any compressed gas coupling**

![Warning](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/bf9d8ff4-0318-4ca6-8898-adcd0ab2ad33)
Do not release gas connections without first disconnecting the gas supply and discharging any residual pressure to zero

**Warnings**

**Explosion Hazard - Wear eye protection and use protective shields or screens whenever there is a possibility of a potential hazard from the failure of a specimen, assembly, or structure under test**

![Helmet   Goggle](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/f0be9496-6e3d-4b2d-b1a4-a9c9495166c8)
Wear eye protection and use protective shields or screens whenever there is a risk of injury to operators and observers due to the failure of a test specimen, assembly, or structure, especially where explosive disintegration may occur. Due to the wide range of specimen materials, assemblies, or structures that may be tested, any hazard resulting from the failure of a test specimen, assembly, or structure must be assessed on a priory basis and suitable precautionary procedures have to be taken.

**Hazard - Ensure components of the load string are correctly pre-loaded to minimize the risk of fatigue failure**

![Warning](https://github.com/ArunKrChannappa/Operation-Instruction-Manual/assets/135500911/3f7d126b-3650-4355-8936-54e718f389de)
Dynamic systems, especially where load reversals through zero are occurring, are at risk of fatigue cracks developing if components of the load string are not correctly pre-loaded to one another. Apply the specified torque to all load string fasteners and the correct setting to wedge washers or spiral washers. Visually inspect highly stressed components such as grips and threaded adapters before every fatigue test for signs of wear or fatigue damage.
